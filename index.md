# Welcome to our data science project on the NBA!

As avid basketball fans (and players) who hypothesise about trends in the NBA and since we are both intrigued by data science, we aim to prove or disprove these hypotheses with data.

We will draw from concepts in data engineering to collect and prepare data for various applications we will develop. With the aid of machine learning and statistics, we will generate insights in different scenarios, for example fantasy leagues, player and team analyses. And finally, we will visualise our analyses through a number of graphs and dashboards.

We will develop all the tools to perform all these tasks. We do this beacause we aim to have a holistic approach to the entire process of data-driven decision making.

A the tools include but are not limited to:
- web scrapers to collect data
- pipelines for data processing
- dashboards for data visualisation
- data modelling

Finally, we will model this data to identify patterns and generate insights on the game that has captivated us both. With this approach, we develop our own skills in all things data to become knowledgeable data science practitioners.

We organise this project in several branches. Please feel free to peruse them to see our work on different applications. Some noteable branches are:

- data_engineering (data engineering)
- pistons (a dashboard built for the Detroit Pistions)

### Hey, we all have to start somewhere. Why not here?
