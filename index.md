## An NBA Data Science Project

As avid basketball fans (and players), Isaaac and I started this project to make our own visualisations and analysis of the NBA currently and historically. 

The goals of this project are to explore data on NBA players and teams with visualisations through interactive dashboards and to develop a methodology to identify patterns in the NBA seasons.

We will build these modularly. This includes web scrapers to collect the data, data cleaning and preprocessing, data visualisation and finially model this data to identify patterns and generate insights on the game that has captivated us both.

Ideas for visualisation include: a dashboard that includes graphs showing the up to the top 10 players at each position for a variety of statistics of interest in a given year. Another idea is to display this same data over a range of years to see which players are consistent or are experiencing decline.

Ideas for data modelling include determining predictors (both player and team statistics) for success in future NBA regular seasons and perhaps even the playoffs. 


<!-- You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Blunt10K/NBA/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
