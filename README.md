# Welcome to our data science project on the NBA!

We're two basketball fanatics who hypothesise about trends in the NBA and since we are both intrigued by data science, we aim to prove or disprove these hypotheses with data. That is the purpose of this project. We will be able to test our hypotheses in the fantasy league we are participating in. 

We will develop all the tools to collect, process and analyse the data. We do this beacause we aim to have a holistic approach to the entire process of data-driven decision making process. With this approach, we develop our own skills in all things data to become knowledgeable data science practitioners.

Hey, we all have to start somewhere. Why not here?
