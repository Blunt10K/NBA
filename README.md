<!-- # Welcome to our data science project on the NBA! -->

As avid basketball fans (and players) who hypothesise about trends in the NBA and since we are both intrigued by data science, we aim to prove or disprove these hypotheses with data. We will be able to test the validity of our hypotheses by making optimal decision in the fantasy league we are participating in. 

We will develop all the tools modularly to collect, process and analyse the data. We do this beacause we aim to have a holistic approach to the entire process of data-driven decision making process. This includes developing web scrapers to collect the data, creating a pipeline to do data cleaning, preprocessing and  visualisation. Finally, we will model this data to identify patterns and generate insights on the game that has captivated us both. With this approach, we develop our own skills in all things data to become knowledgeable data science practitioners.

Hey, we all have to start somewhere. Why not here?
<!-- Ideas for visualisation include: a dashboard that includes graphs showing the up to the top 10 players at each position for a variety of statistics of interest in a given year. Another idea is to display this same data over a range of years to see which players are consistent or are experiencing decline.

Ideas for data modelling include determining predictors (both player and team statistics) for success in future NBA regular seasons and perhaps even the playoffs.  -->
