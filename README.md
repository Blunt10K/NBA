# NBA scoring performance anlysis

This branch is devoted to the analysis of scoring performances using box score data.

## Motivation

This project is aimed at characterising scoring performances common in the NBA. With these charaterisations, we can find answers to the following questions:

- Who are the superstars who take control of games, leading in points?
- What other contributions are made?
- Are any groups of players who are underrated in scoring?
- Who makes indispensible contributions to a team's performance? 
- Do teams rely on sole superstars or does everyone contribute?
    - Which ones tend to win championships?

## Value

The answers to the above questions lead to a better understanding of scoring trends in the NBA. Insights gleaned from this analysis can help make decision about the direction teams can possibly take when approaching the task of scoring in the NBA.
